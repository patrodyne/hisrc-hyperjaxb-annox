# HiSrc HyperJAXB Annox

XJC plugin to add arbitrary Java annotations to JAXB.

## Description

This repository is a fork of [jaxb2-annotate-plugin][24]. The original project was developed by the admirable
Alexey Valikov (a.k.a. [Highsource][2]). This repository contains Java projects to build Maven artifact(s)
related to the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) framework. It is one of a family of repositories
forked from [Highsource][2] that provide tools for JAXB and JPA processing. Repo and artifact names have
been changed to reflect the familial connection between the repositories and to fix a conformance issue
with the original `maven-jaxb2-plugin` name.
